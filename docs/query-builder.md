# RoamJS Query Builder

Query Builder can be used to create queries via a [Query Block](#query-blocks), [Query Pages](#query-pages), or the [Query Drawer](#query-drawer).

These queries are far more powerful than vanilla Roam queries, as it taps into Roam's underlying query language surfaced through an approachable UI.

## Query Blocks

The above UI is available as a block component. This allows you to create several on a page, wherever on the page you want.

To create one, simply add `{{query block}}` to any block on the page.

## Query Pages

With Query Pages, you designate certain pages in your Roam graph as "views" into your data.

On the Roam Depot Settings page for Query Builder, you should see a setting called `Query Pages`. You could use this to denote which page titles in your Roam Graph will be used to create query pages. Use the `*` as a wildcard.

By default, Query Pages is set to be titled with `queries/*`. This means any page in your graph prefixed with `queries/` can be used to save a query. You can denote multiple page title formats.

Example: `[[queries/Demo]]`

## Query Drawer

The above UI is also available as a left hand drawer, accessible from the command palette. This allows you to execute a query no matter where in your graph you are.

To open, enter `Open Query Drawer` from the Roam Command Palette.

## Usage

Create a [Query Block](#query-blocks), navigate to a [Query Page](#query-pages), or open the [Query Drawer](#query-drawer) to begin to building your query. You can use this editor to create and save a query.

There are two important parts to a query: [Conditions](#conditions) and [Selections](#selections).

After specifying conditions and selections, hit the `Query` button to return results in your graph. These results will always include a `text` field which will link to the relevant block or page reference. Hitting `Query` also effectively "Saves" the query to the graph.

The results returned will be organized in a table with sortable and filterable columns. Click on the columns to sort the data and use the filter icon to narrow down the table to your desired results:

## Conditions

**Conditions** specify which blocks you want to return. They determine the **rows** of the table. The anatomy of a Condition is a triple: `source`, `relationship`, & `target`:

You can use a combination of multiple **conditions** to select the data you want.

`relationship`s will autocomplete as you type:

## Selections

**Selections** specify what data from the blocks that match your conditions get returned. They determine the **columns** of the table. By default, the block text or page title is always returned and hyperlinked. Every selection is made up of two parts: the `label` and the `data`:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froamjs%2F_HPRxD7QLa.jpg?alt=media&token=ef75e680-3bd5-4869-8ed0-117c03b4f232)

The `label`, which gets specified after **AS**, denotes the name of the column that gets used. The `data`, which gets specified after **Select**, denotes what kind of data to return.

### Supported Data Types

**Metadata**

| Data             | Description                            | Example                            |

## Manipulating Results

After you fire a query, the results will output in a table view. There are multiple ways to post process these results after they output to the screen.

### Sort<!-- omit in toc -->

Clicking on the table header for a given column will trigger an alphabetical sort. Clicking again will toggle descending order. Clicking once more will toggle the sort off. You could have multiple columns selected for sorting:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froamjs%2FP1-KDvuRhS.png?alt=media&token=b85999f9-f9a6-4a36-acc9-bb15724507a3)

### Filter<!-- omit in toc -->

Each column is also filterable. The filter works just like the page and reference filters in native Roam, where you could pick values to include and remove:

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froamjs%2FG7d1TrIzNq.png?alt=media&token=8df90fc5-5e8d-4347-9721-bd067ac7616a)

### Search

Enable search by clicking on the Menu button, then Search.

This will allow you to search across all columns, case-insensitive.

https://github.com/RoamJS/query-builder/assets/3792666/6499147d-4d03-4767-b7e7-d1ea925697b5

### View Type<!-- omit in toc -->

Each column also has a view type. Choosing a view type will change how the cell is displayed in the table.

The supported view types are:

| View Type | Description                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `plain`   | Outputted as plain text                               |
| `link`    | Outputted as text that links to the block or page     |
| `embed`   | Embeds the contents of the block or page in the cell. |

All changes to the outputted results are saved automatically.

## Layouts

By default, the query builder will use the `Table` layout. You can switch to a different layout by hitting the more menu on the top right of the results and clicking on the `Layout` option.

The following layouts are available:

| Layout     | Description                                         | Example                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Line`     | Displays your data as a line chart.                 | [Link](examples.md#Line)     |
| `Bar`      | Displays your data as a bar chart.                  | [Link](examples.md#Bar)      |
| `Timeline` | Displays your data as an interactive timeline view. | [Link](examples.md#Timeline) |
| `Kanban`   | Displays your data as a Kanban board.               | [Link](examples.md#Kanban)   |

## Exporting

Next to the save button is a button that will allow you to export your results. There are currently two formats available to export to:

- CSV - All the columns in the table will become columns in the CSV
- Markdown - The columns will become frontmatter data and the children of the block or page will become markdown content.

## Styling

Every [Query Block](#query-blocks) or [Query Page](#query-pages) is rooted with a `div` that has an `id` of `roamjs-query-page-${uid}` where `uid` is the block reference of the query block or the page reference of the page. You could use this id to style individual queries with affecting other ones.

## SmartBlocks Integration

This extension comes with its own SmartBlocks command! The `<%QUERYBUILDER%>` command will run an existing [Query Block](#query-blocks) or [Query Page](#query-pages) instance in your graph and return the results as separate blocks. The command takes in two arguments:

1. The block reference, alias, or page title of the query instance
1. The format to output each result in. You can use placeholders, like `{text}` to insert the value from the result in. There's a placeholder available for each Selection label used in the query.

### Alias

You can set the alias of a [Query Block](#query-blocks) in the top right corner of the UI.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froamjs%2FBRQ-hhJpLe.jpg?alt=media&token=d0b9afb1-0189-4904-bab8-420e032f1da6)

The end of the title of a [Query Page](#query-pages) works as well.

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froamjs%2F3VGMt6toTB.jpg?alt=media&token=51d851d3-0954-4300-9be4-2bcb13ed95d2)

### Examples

`<%QUERYBUILDER:6-qLCJsSb,{text}%>`

`<%QUERYBUILDER:myQuery,{uid}%>`

`<%QUERYBUILDER:queries/myQuery%>`

## Developer API

For developers of other extensions who want to use the queries defined by users, we expose the following API, available on the global `window.roamjs.extension.queryBuilder` object:

- `listActiveQueries` - `() => { uid: string }[]` Returns an array of blocks or pages where the user has a query defined from query builder.
- `runQuery` - `(uid: string) => Promise<Result[]>` Runs the query defined at the input `uid` and returns a promise that resolves to the array of results from the user's graphs. `Result`s have the following schema:
  - `text` - `string` The page title or block text of the primary node involved in the result.
  - `uid` - `string` The reference of the primary node involved in the result.
  - `${string}-uid` - `string` If the users define selections that return intermediary nodes, the reference of those nodes will always end in `-uid` and will always be of type `string`.
  - `{string}` - `string | number | Date` All other fields returned in the result can be any of the primitive value types.
