## Migrate to the Roam Depot Version

The Discourse Graph plugin is bundled with the Query Builder plugin.

To migrate to the new version, you must disable the old version in `roam/js`, then enable it in Query Builder

### **Step 1**: Uninstall the `roam/js` Discourse Graph

- Open this in the sidebar: Discourse Graph (Shift - Click)

- Click on the "Stop this" button. It will look something like:

- The end result should look like this:

**Important:** Once you see that, refresh your page by hitting the refresh button in your browser / device.

Then continue to: Step 2: Install Query Builder

**If you didn't see a yellow "Stop this" button, proceed follow these instructions:**

Find where you have installed Discourse Graph currently via `{{[[roam/js]]}}`. If you are unsure where you have Discourse Graph currently installed you can go to the `[[roam/js]]` page and look through the linked references. It will look something like:
