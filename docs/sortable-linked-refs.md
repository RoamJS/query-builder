# Sortable Linked References

In your Roam Depot Settings, there is a flag called `Sortable Linked References`. When enabled, there will appear a sort icon next to the filter icon near the linked references. Clicking on the sort icon will make a sort menu visible to the user.

You could also add a `Default Sort` attribute with a valid value on the page itself to have a specific sorting for just that page.

Here are the options you can sort by:

| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sort By Created Date            | This will sort all the linked references in ascending order that the page was created.                                        |
| Sort By Created Date Descending | This will sort all the linked references in descending order that the page was created.                                       |
| Sort By Daily Note              | This will sort all the linked references in ascending order by Daily Note, followed by created date of non-daily note pages.  |
| Sort By Daily Note Descending   | This will sort all the linked references in descending order by Daily Note, followed by created date of non-daily note pages. |
| Sort By Page Title              | This will sort all the linked references in ascending alphabetical order of the page title.                                   |
| Sort By Page Title Descending   | This will sort all the linked references in descending alphabetical order of the page title.                                  |
